A Python-based online quiz game using Panel and MySQL
# Online Quiz Game 🧠🎮

This is my **first project**, built from scratch while learning Python application development.

The project is an interactive Online Quiz Game developed using **Python**, **Panel**, and **MySQL**.  
It includes both **Player** and **Admin** functionalities such as quiz attempts, score tracking, leaderboard, and question management.

I used **YouTube tutorials** and **ChatGPT** as learning resources to understand concepts, clarify doubts, and guide my implementation while figuring out the logic and flow on my own.
